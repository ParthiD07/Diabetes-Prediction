# Diabetes Prediction
### Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict diabetes using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model is trained on a dataset of medical records and aims to provide an accurate prediction based on various health metrics.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting.
- **Model Training:** Implements a Decision Tree Classifier for prediction.
- **Evaluation:** Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to evaluate the model.
- **Prediction:** Allows users to input new data and get diabetes prediction results.

### Dataset

The model is trained on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset, which includes the following features:

- Gender
- Age
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Smoking History
- BMI
- HbA1c Level
- Blood Glucose Level

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- IDE- Jupyter Notebook/VS Code (optional, for exploring the notebook)
